"""If the names of 2 friends are same; what will happen to the program in problem 
6?"""
# Answer: The program will run successfully but the value of the first friend will be overwritten by the value of the second friend.
# The dictionary will have only 3 key-value pairs. The value of the first friend will be lost.
# This is because the keys in a dictionary are unique. If the same key is used again, the value of the key is overwritten.
